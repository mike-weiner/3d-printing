A case for the Raspberry Pi 5 with a Pimoroni NVE Base installed.

## Adjustments

- `bottom` plate dimensions were increased to 91.2 x 62.2 x 24.67 mm
    - The standoffs that came with my Pimoroni NVE Base were taller than what this 3D model was created for. I scaled the bottom part of the case to be taller to adjust for these larger standoffs.
- `top` plate dimensions were increased to 91.2 x 62.2 x 20.80 mm
    - This was due to the slots on the top plate that hold the tabs from the bottom plate being too short.
